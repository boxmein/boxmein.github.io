The challenge was simple - make this car go around the track, when the simulator will tell you how far off you are.
To do this, especially since the simulator tells us an error metric, I needed to build a PID controller.
A PID controller is a simple function that relates the error (how off we are from our trajectory) to a control variable (throttle/steering/&mldr;).&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/2017-08-06-using-pid-to-drive-like-vin-diesel/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2017-07-29-using-particle-filters-to-localize-a-car-in-2d-space/>Using Particle Filters to localize a car in 2D space</a></h1><time>Jul 29, 2017</time><br><div class=description>This is a discussion on how I implemented and finished the Particle Filters project in the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.
