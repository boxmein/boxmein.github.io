Rubric This is a per-point addressment of the Udacity review rubric. It&rsquo;s sort of like filling a form instead of writing freeform text, but I hope reviewing the document is therefore easier and more structured.
A reference to the rubric is visible here: rubric.

The first project of the SDCND is about lane line detection.
