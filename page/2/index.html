The challenge Given a map of the world (a bunch of landmarks), and the car drawing lines to all landmarks within range with noisy data, give the best assumption for the car&rsquo;s position in the world.
The process How I was going to solve it was with an approach called particle filters.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/2017-07-29-using-particle-filters-to-localize-a-car-in-2d-space/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2017-06-04-using-extended-kalman-filters-for-object-tracking/>Using Extended Kalman Filters for object tracking</a></h1><time>Jun 4, 2017</time><br><div class=description>This is a discussion of how I solved the Extended Kalman Filters project in the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.
The problem Our car has two sensors: a lidar and a radar. Both can see a pedestrian. Based on the lidar and radar data (both a bit noisy), keep track of the pedestrian&rsquo;s position and velocity.
The solution Kalman filters offer a solution that can combine both lidar and radar data to complement each other, and a robust object-tracking model that also keeps track of the error margins.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/2017-06-04-using-extended-kalman-filters-for-object-tracking/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2017-04-28-writeup-vehicle-detection/>Writeup: Vehicle Detection</a></h1><time>Apr 28, 2017</time><br><div class=description>Vehicle Detection Project** This is a writeup for my Vehicle Detection project.
Goals The goals / steps of this project are the following:
Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. Note: for those first two steps don&rsquo;t forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/2017-04-28-writeup-vehicle-detection/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2017-04-21-writeup-advanced-lane-finding/>Writeup: Advanced Lane Finding</a></h1><time>Apr 21, 2017</time><br><div class=description>Advanced Lane Finding Project The goals / steps of this project are the following:
Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images. Apply a distortion correction to raw images. Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image. Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image (&ldquo;birds-eye view&rdquo;). Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary. Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/2017-04-21-writeup-advanced-lane-finding/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2017-03-31-writeup-behavioral-cloning/>Writeup: Behavioral Cloning</a></h1><time>Mar 31, 2017</time><br><div class=description>This one-to-one copy of my writeup for Udacity follows the format in the writeup template, hopefully making the writeup more thorough and easier to grade.

Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images Train and validate the model with a training and validation set Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road Summarize the results with a written report Rubric Points Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/2017-03-31-writeup-behavioral-cloning/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2017-03-09-writeup-traffic-sign-classifier/>Writeup: Traffic Sign Classifier</a></h1><time>Mar 9, 2017</time><br><div class=description>This is a one-to-one copy of the writeup for my traffic sign classifier.
Rubric This is a per-point addressment of the Udacity review rubric. It&rsquo;s sort of like filling a form instead of writing freeform text, but I hope reviewing the document is therefore easier and more structured.
A reference to the rubric is visible here: rubric.
