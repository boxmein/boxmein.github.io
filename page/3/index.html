You read something about a &ldquo;relay&rdquo; - a switch that you can operate with low power to control a circuit with bigger power, and bought one or even two. You sort of looked at the specs of the thing, mostly the &ldquo;wow, this can relay a 230V voltage!&rdquo; aspect, and bought two to attach to your Pi.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/2016-08-20-how-to-drive-a-relay-with-raspberry-pi/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2016-01-23-playstation-portable-day-1/>Playstation Portable: Day 1</a></h1><time>Jan 23, 2016</time><br><div class=description>This is a new project I&rsquo;m literally working on at this very moment.

It&rsquo;s for the language called Unnecessary, which basically is this:
Unnecessary is a programming language from 2005 by Keymaker where the existence of a program file is considered an error. The valid Unnecessary program file extension is &lsquo;unn&rsquo;. However, if there is no program file, the interpreter or compiler can work normally and perform a nop.
So basically if the file exists you&rsquo;re having an error.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/2013-09-17-unnecessary/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/2013-09-17-words-that-dont-share-letters-with-us-state-names/>Words that don't share letters with US state names</a></h1><time>Sep 17, 2013</time><br><div class=description>A while ago an interesting question was posed in a comment thread, to which I, being someone not from the US who couldn&rsquo;t remember state names, wanted an answer to in the easiest way possible.
So what do I do? I write a script for it. In Ruby.
The script follows:

Really basic. I go through each of the arguments passed in the command line, each of the state names and just try if something doesn&rsquo;t share letters with a state it outputs both strings.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/2013-09-17-words-that-dont-share-letters-with-us-state-names/>Read more ⟶</a></section><ul class=pagination><span class="page-item page-prev"><a href=/page/2/ class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>← Prev</span></a></span>
