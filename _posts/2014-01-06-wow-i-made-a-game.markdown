title: A game? 
---

So this time I wrote a game. In Python. With Pygame. It actually exists in 
real life. In a form of bits on a platter. Submitted it to my game 
programming course too, just for the heck of it. 

The programming course I'm attending has this thing with code samples in that it
posts *images* of it. Not code itself. Perfectly clearly readable, syntax-
highlighted, JPEG-encoded *images*. Knowingly too. Say it invokes
understanding, or some other higher purpose. Stuff spanning almost a hundred
lines, which one has to painstakingly re-type into whichever text editor they
get - stuff that doesn't even introduce anything new to the reader. I got  wrist
pains retyping all that. Maybe I should get that checked out...

Aside that, once in Week 3 the students received an image of code for a  simple
set-up game which had a background and a sprite in the foreground. I'd, for fun,
added some key control to the sprite, made the stage have physical borders and
then refined the sprite's controls until I was satisfied with them. Friction and
acceleration and the whole works.

The velocity was for each tick divided by the friction, so I figured I'd try
what friction did when it was less than one. The sprite sped up as it moved
along the virtual plane. An idea for a simple game sparked, one I could  present
to the class teachers in time, instead of the god-awful *Simon* code  I'd
written the night before.

I polished off the code, added some user interaction and game elements such as
increasing difficulty, an end and start screen to finish it off and shipped it 
off as-is. It's not like we needed the entire game right now... The deadline was
for one half of it.

Speaking of which, how do you send half a game? Does one just cut the script in 
two or... how is 'half' measured in a game? In terms of functionality? Because 
I intend on adding a lot more to the game aside from this shell I have
currently.

I'm interested in the teacher's feedback.
