I made the most pointless esoteric language interpreter today. It's for the language called Unnecessary, which basically is this:

_**Unnecessary** is a programming language from [2005](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Category:2005 "Category:2005") by [Keymaker](http://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Keymaker "User:Keymaker") where the existence of a program file is considered an error. The valid Unnecessary program file extension is 'unn'. However, if there is no program file, the interpreter or compiler can work normally and perform a [nop](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Nop "Nop")._

So basically if the file exists you're having an error. If not, good for you, we have a no-op run.

How idiotically simple :D
