I made the most pointless esoteric language interpreter today. It's for the language called Unnecessary, which basically is this:

Unnecessary is a programming language from 2005 by Keymaker where the existence of a program file is considered an error. The valid Unnecessary program file extension is 'unn'. However, if there is no program file, the interpreter or compiler can work normally and perform a nop.

So basically if the file exists you're having an error. If not, good for you, we have a no-op run.

How idiotically simple :D
