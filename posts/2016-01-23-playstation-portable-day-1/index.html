Shortly, this is the oldest model of the PSP, released in 2004. Featuring, wifi and infrared connectivity, a 480x272 screen, and a whopping 32 megabytes of RAM!!</p><p>For storage, you need a Memory Stick Pro Duo memory card. I dare you to go to your favorite tech store and find any of those&mldr; I searched everywhere and found one store that sold a 20GB card for 25â‚¬. On the IRC, a friend told me these things can just be converted into MicroSD cards so I did what any sensible human would do and bought a MicroSD instead. For USB connectivity the device would need a Mini USB</p><p>So what the PSP will first and foremost need is a firmware update, and a custom firmware patch to let me run unsigned code on the bad boy. Right now, I still need to figure out why it&rsquo;s not detecting the software update on my memory card though :(</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex></div><div class=footer-info>2022 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
