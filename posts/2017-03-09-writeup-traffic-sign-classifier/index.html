The dataset sizes were 34799 for original training data, 4410 for original validation data and 12630 for original testing data.</p><p>The cross validation function I used simply used the entire validation set for every epoch. No splitting was needed if I used the presplit dataset.</p><p>I augmented the training data by creating 7 images per test image, with random alterations to the luminance. The luminance augmentation source has been taken from a different project, with changes to fit in my current solution, and has been linked in the respective code cell.</p><p>My final training set had (34799 + 243593 = 278392) number of images.

Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.</h4><p>For accuracy calculations, I define a function evaluate() in the first cell under the heading &ldquo;Train, Validate and Test the Model&rdquo;. In the final model after training for 40 epochs, my training set loss was 0.106, validation accuracy was 0.961 (96.1%).</p><p>I started off using the LeNet model. We had discussed it in the lessons and it was a good convolutional neural net to base the classifier on.</p><p>To run the traffic sign classifier, it needed a few modifications - namely in the shape of the output layer. It needed to output all 43 classes instead of the 10 for decimals. When running, I discovered it gave a low accuracy of 40% with decent hyperparameters, therefore it was obvious the model needed to be more complex to capture traffic signs.</p><p>I added another convolutional layer and increased the convolution&rsquo;s depth to allow it to learn about more features of the image. To make the model have a stronger &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; of the images, I applied some of the techniques learned in the lessons. I added layers of dropout and another fully connected layer. I adjusted the learning rate lower to increase the model&rsquo;s stability and ran it on a faster machine to allow it time to train.</p><h3 id=httpsgithubcomboxmeincarnd-traffic-sign-classifier-projectblobmasterwriteup_templatemdtest-a-model-on-new-imagestest-a-model-on-new-images><a href=https://github.com/boxmein/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/writeup_template.md#test-a-model-on-new-images></a>Test a Model on New Images</h3><h4 id=httpsgithubcomboxmeincarnd-traffic-sign-classifier-projectblobmasterwriteup_templatemd1-choose-five-german-traffic-signs-found-on-the-web-and-provide-them-in-the-report-for-each-image-discuss-what-quality-or-qualities-might-be-difficult-to-classify1-choose-five-german-traffic-signs-found-on-the-web-and-provide-them-in-the-report-for-each-image-discuss-what-quality-or-qualities-might-be-difficult-to-classify><a href=https://github.com/boxmein/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/writeup_template.md#1-choose-five-german-traffic-signs-found-on-the-web-and-provide-them-in-the-report-for-each-image-discuss-what-quality-or-qualities-might-be-difficult-to-classify></a>1.

This is lower than the accuracy on the validation set, worse than desired.
