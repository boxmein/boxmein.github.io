Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search. How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?</h4><p>I implemented a sliding window search method in the search phase, in <code>lesson_functions.py</code> lines 199-227. I then implemented the search function in <code>vehicledetector.py</code> lines 31-46 (lines 46-67 are the heatmapping function) to search over 3 scales, specifying overlap and sizes.</p><p>I specified my search scales in terms of a &ldquo;window size&rdquo; hyperparameter called <code>WS</code> which is 32px. My smallest scale was WS x WS, the medium scale was 3 * WS x 3 * WS, and the largest scale was 6 * WS x 6 * WS. Note all hyperparameters have been pulled to hyperparameters.py.</p><p>For window overlap, I tested multiple times with varying results. I got the best results with a lot of overlap, since bigger windows would then be able to more closely approximate the car&rsquo;s bounding box. I ended up using 80% overlap for my large scale, 75% overlap for the medium scale and 50% overlap for the small scale.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a table with all the scales:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Scale</th><th>Size</th><th>Overlap</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Large</td><td>192x192</td><td>80%</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>96x96</td><td>75%</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>32x32</td><td>50%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I also selected start/stop coordinates for the windows to prevent them from scanning areas that cars of relevant size will not appear.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an image of windows (cyan = small, blue = medium, green = large), with red squares marking live detections:</p><p><a href=https://github.com/boxmein/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/examples/Windows.png><img src=images/Windows.png alt></a></p><h4 id=httpsgithubcomboxmeincarnd-vehicle-detectionblobmasterwriteup_templatemd2-show-some-examples-of-test-images-to-demonstrate-how-your-pipeline-is-working--what-did-you-do-to-optimize-the-performance-of-your-classifier2-show-some-examples-of-test-images-to-demonstrate-how-your-pipeline-is-working-what-did-you-do-to-optimize-the-performance-of-your-classifier><a href=https://github.com/boxmein/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md#2-show-some-examples-of-test-images-to-demonstrate-how-your-pipeline-is-working--what-did-you-do-to-optimize-the-performance-of-your-classifier></a>2.

Provide a link to your final video output. Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)</h4><p>The end pipeline performs pretty well on the project video, creating bounding boxes that approximate the shape of the car.

Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.</h4><p>To filter for false positives, I spent a lot of time tuning the processing and messing with classifier parameters to provide the least possible false positives.</p><p>After all that was done, I implemented a heatmap by mapping windows over multiple frames and thresholding the map to create a map of vehicle positions.</p><p>This heatmap and labelling is done in vehicledetector.py lines 48-65.</p><p>I then used <code>scipy.ndimage.measurements.label</code> to identify blobs in the heatmap and assign them to a vehicle.

Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.</h4><p><strong>Where will your pipeline likely fail? What could you do to make it more robust?</strong></p><p>When I was implementing this project, I had a lot of <a href=https://github.com/boxmein/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/Prototype%20Videos/1493150619.582245_test_video.mp4>trouble isolating false positives</a> from road shadows. What helped me most here was running the classifier on the entire dataset, giving it a much better understanding of the difference between road and car.</p><p>I also had some trouble detecting the white car. Perhaps this is because of the dataset, as white cars are less common than other colors and this might have thrown the color histogram function off.</p><p>As well as that, I did not know where to start - I didn&rsquo;t have a mental roadmap in front of me, of which part to implement first and which second.</p><p>My pipeline will likely fail on roads that go outside the window area (ie, slopes or hills, as well as steeper curves and intersections). For these to work, the classifier needs to be trained more thoroughly and the image pipeline improved. There should be more windows in a larger area.</p><p>My pipeline may not generalize too well to different conditions - I didn&rsquo;t augment the data with brightness or translation adjustments as well as more non-road imagery. This means that the classifier might work best on a clear day.</p><p>Thank you for reading this writeup!</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex></div><div class=footer-info>2023 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
